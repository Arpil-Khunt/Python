#you can assign string using sigle quate, double quate,  and tripe single quate or triple double quate
#In python String follow 0-base indexing
#This all three structure is valid, but we use double quate to assing string by convention

#we use all this formate according to our usecase 
#like if we want to print string like double quate then we use

#if we want to print string in single quate
